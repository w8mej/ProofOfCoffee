#
# Purpose:
#   Defines the Python package dependencies required to run the MPC Ephemeral
#   Signing Proof-of-Concept (Coordinator, Ephemeral CA, Transparency Log,
#   AuthN services, and CLI client).
#
# Security & Ops notes:
#   - Pin versions in production to ensure reproducible builds and avoid
#     unverified upstream changes.
#   - In high-security environments, vendor and verify all dependencies via
#     cryptographic hashes (e.g., `pip install --require-hashes`).
#   - Audit dependencies for known CVEs before deployment (e.g., `pip-audit`).
#   - For FIPS-compliant environments, ensure `cryptography` build is linked
#     against an approved OpenSSL version.
#
# Tunables:
#   - Versions may be upgraded in development to access new features, but
#     production should pass through a regression/security testing pipeline.
