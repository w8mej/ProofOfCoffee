# Proof of Coffee

A curated collection of security-flavored Proof of Concepts exploring different security automation experiments, crafted by **John Menerick** — engineer, researcher, and breaker of things (on purpose).

> ⚠ **Disclaimer:** These PoCs are **not production-ready** — they’re here to demonstrate ideas, not to be deployed as-is.

## What’s Inside
- **Vault + YubiKey integration** for creative authentication flows.
- **PKI automation** with Terraform and Vault.
- **JWT, OTP, and SSH certificate** experiments.
- **Infrastructure as Code** for ephemeral, disposable labs.
- **Tamper evident** compute.
- **Multi-party** compute.

## Why It Exists
These projects are snapshots of *“Can this be done?”* moments — designed to break, teach, and inspire.  
They’re proof that automation can be equal parts useful and ridiculous.

---

## How to Use
1. Read the code.
2. Steal the patterns you like.
3. Rewrite them properly for production.
