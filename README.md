# Proof of Coffee: The Archive

> **Note:** This repository serves as a historical index. The Proof of Concepts listed below have graduated to their own dedicated repositories.

## ☕ The Collection

**Proof of Coffee** is a curated portfolio of advanced security automation experiments, exploring the boundaries of what is possible with modern infrastructure and cryptographic primitives.

Each project represents a specific "what if" scenario—from hardware-backed multi-party computation to zero-trust CI/CD pipelines—demonstrating that security can be both rigorous and creative.

### 📂 Graduated Projects

The following projects have moved to their own homes to facilitate focused development and community contribution.

## 👨‍💻 About the Architect

**John Menerick** is a distinguished security engineer and researcher known for breaking things to build them better. With a deep focus on **detection engineering**, **infrastructure security**, and **cryptographic orchestration**, John crafts solutions that challenge the status quo of security automation.

This collection stands as a testament to the philosophy that **security should be an enabler**, not a blocker—and that the most robust systems are often born from the most creative experiments.
