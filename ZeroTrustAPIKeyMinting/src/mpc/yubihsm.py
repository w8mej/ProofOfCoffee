"""
yubihsm.py â€” Local wrapper for retrieving an MPC share from YubiKey-protected storage.

Purpose
-------
Encapsulates the retrieval of a single Shamir MPC share stored on disk (or in a mounted
secure device) in JSON format. In this PoC, the `path` attribute simply points to a
JSON file containing {"x": int, "y": int}. In production, this could instead be a
secure mount from a YubiKey PIV applet, encrypted filesystem, or TEE-attached storage.

Operational Guidance
--------------------
- Path format: expects a valid UTF-8 JSON file with keys "x" and "y", both integers.
- Custody: each share should be stored on a distinct hardware token or HSM-backed
  storage volume, ideally with independent custodians.
- Access control: protect file permissions so only the intended process/user can read.
- This class is designed for synchronous, read-only retrieval; no mutation or share
  splitting occurs here.

Production Considerations
-------------------------
- Replace filesystem open() calls with PKCS#11 or hardware-specific retrieval logic.
- Add signature/MAC verification of the share payload to detect tampering.
- Zeroize share values in memory immediately after use.
- Consider loading into volatile memory only (tmpfs/ramfs) when possible.

Example
-------
>>> dev = YubiShareDevice("/secure_mount/share_1.json")
>>> x, y = dev.get_share()
>>> print(f"Share index {x} with value {y}")
