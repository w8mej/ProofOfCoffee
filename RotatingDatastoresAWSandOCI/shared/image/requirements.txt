# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Python dependencies for Multi-Cloud Credential Rotation Worker (PoC)
# This list supports running on both AWS Lambda (container) and OCI Functions.
#
# SECURITY & OPS NOTES (PoC)
# - Versions are pinned to prevent drift and supply-chain surprises.
# - Only install whatâ€™s required for credential rotation; no unnecessary packages.
# - In production: enable hash-pinning (pip-tools or Poetry) and scan with SCA tools.
