# iam.tf
# Purpose: Grant the Function least-privilege access to Vault and Object Storage
# Status: PROOF OF CONCEPT â€“ NOT FOR PRODUCTION
#
# What this code does:
# - Creates a Dynamic Group that matches Functions in the compartment.
# - Attaches a Policy allowing that Dynamic Group to:
#   * use secret-family (read/update secret versions) in the compartment
#   * manage objects in the specific audit bucket (write audit logs)
#   * use object-family for Object Storage interactions (narrowed by bucket name)
#
# Security & Ops notes (PoC):
# - The matching rule scopes to fnfunc resources in the given compartment.
# - Policy includes "manage objects" limited by target.bucket.name to minimize blast radius.
# - Consider splitting policies for read vs write and scoping namespace/bucket more tightly.
#
# Tunables:
# - Change matching_rule if you want to scope to a specific function OCID instead of the whole compartment.
# - Update the bucket name predicate if you rename the audit bucket.
