# events.tf
# Purpose: Schedule OCI Functions to run every 20 minutes and rotate credentials
# Status: PROOF OF CONCEPT â€“ NOT FOR PRODUCTION
#
# What this code does:
# - Creates an OCI Events scheduled rule (cron 0/20) that invokes the rotation Function.
#
# Security & Ops notes (PoC):
# - No DLQ/retry routing is defined here; failures rely on Function retry behavior/logs.
#   Production: add monitoring/alarms on function errors and consider a queue-based pattern.
# - Rule is scoped to the provided compartment for least privilege.
#
# Tunables:
# - Change cron() for cadence; e.g., "cron(0 0/1 * * ? *)" for hourly.
# - Toggle is_enabled for quick pausing.
